            You'll have the power to make the battle between two opponents from Star Wars Universe. You'll see two cards next to each other representing them.
            The only thing you need is to click on "roll the dice" button and wait when system will randomly choose characters or starships to compare.
            Once winner will be shown to you, you can reroll the dice and play again!
